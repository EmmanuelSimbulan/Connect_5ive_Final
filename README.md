# Connect 5ive

Connect 5ive is a Python implementation of the classic board game Connect Four using the Pygame library. The game allows two players to take turns placing colored discs on a grid, with the objective of connecting five discs in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## Installation

To run Connect 5ive, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Install Pygame by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to start the game:

   ```bash
   python connect_5ive.py
   ```

3. The game window will open, and you will see the game board. Player 1 is represented by red discs, and Player 2 is represented by yellow discs.
4. Players take turns placing their discs by clicking on the desired column. The disc will fall to the lowest empty position in that column.
5. The game continues until one player successfully connects five discs in a row or the game board is full (resulting in a tie).
6. After the game ends, you can close the game window or press the "Esc" key to exit the program.
